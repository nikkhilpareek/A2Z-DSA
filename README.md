# Data Structures and Algorithms from A to Z.
This Repository is the home of all the pieces of code I have written or I will be writing during my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. <br> 

I will be using [A2Z DSA Sheet by Striver](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) as my main source of learning in this course. 

Platforms Used for Practice - Majorly Coding Ninjas & Leetcode, may do some questions on various other platforms if i find the question interesting.

*Folder for Leetcode questions I solved is also there, more details about that is available in its own readme file*

> Below you can Find the Index to Topics I learned in my Journey.

## CPP STL
**Topics:** 
- Pair
- Vector
- List
- Deque
- Stack
- Queue (basic queue, Priority Queue, Minimum Heap)
- Set(basic set, multiset, unordered_set)
- Map(basic map, multimap, unordered_map)

## Basic Maths
**Topics:** 
- Digit Extraction
- Reverse a Number
- Check Palindrome
- Armstrong Number
- Print All Divisors
- Check Prime Numbers
- GCD/HCF - best approach using Modified Eucledian Algorithm

## Sorting Techniques
**Topics:**
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Recursive Bubble Sort
- Recursive Insertion Sort
> Project Idea: Sorting Visualiser using CPP only

## Arrays
**Topics:**
- Find Largest Element in Array (Brute Force & Optimal Solution)
- Find Second Largest Element in Array (Brute Force, Better & Optimal Solution)
- Check Array is Sorted or Not
- Remove Duplicates in-place from a Sorted Array (Brute Force & Optimal Solution)

- Union of two Sorted Arrays Brute Force Solution
- Union of two Sorted Arrays Optimal Solution
- Intersection of two Sorted Arrays (Brute Force & Optimal Solution)
- Finding Missing Number in an Array (Brute Force, Better, Optimal 1 & Optimal 2 Solution)
- Maximum Consecutive Ones in an Array of 0s and 1s
- Find Number that Appears only once in an Array where all other numbers appear twice.
