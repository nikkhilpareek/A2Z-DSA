# Data Structures and Algorithms from A to Z

This Repository is the home of all the pieces of code I have written or I will be writing during my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. <br>

I will be using [A2Z DSA Sheet by Striver](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) as my main source of learning in this course.

Platforms Used for Practice - Majorly Coding Ninjas & Leetcode, may do some questions on various other platforms if I find the question interesting.

*Folder for Leetcode questions I solved is also there, more details about that is available in its own readme file.*

> Below you can Find the Index to Topics I learned in my Journey.
