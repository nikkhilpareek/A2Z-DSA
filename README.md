# Data Structures and Algorithms from A to Z.
This Repository is the home of all the pieces of code I have written or I will be writing during my journey to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. <br> 

I will be using [A2Z DSA Sheet by Striver](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) as my main source of learning in this course. 

Platforms Used for Practice - Majorly Coding Ninjas & Leetcode, may do some questions on various other platforms if i find the question interesting.

> Below you can Find the Topics I learned in my Journey.
